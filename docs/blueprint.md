# **App Name**: CarbonSight AI

## Core Features:

- Secure User Authentication: Enable users to securely log in using email/password and Google authentication, with JWT-based authentication to protect user data and manage access to the platform.
- Real-time Emissions Tracking: Integrate with live carbon data APIs to fetch and display real-time CO₂ emission levels, machine/vehicle-wise carbon footprint, activity-wise carbon distribution, carbon sink status, and gap analysis.
- AI Carbon Footprint Estimator: Provide an AI-powered tool to predict total carbon emissions based on user input such as number of vehicles, machinery, and diesel usage, leveraging the OpenAI API to analyze and forecast emissions.
- AI Sink Optimization Assistant: Recommend optimal carbon sinks (trees, vegetation, etc.) to offset mine emissions, using AI to analyze emission data and suggest the most effective offsetting strategies.
- AI Net-Zero Path Generator: Automatically generate a step-by-step action plan to achieve carbon neutrality, using AI to create a tailored roadmap based on the mine's specific conditions and goals. Uses a tool to help construct a reasoned and workable plan.
- Automated Report Generation: Generate ESG-friendly carbon emission reports for compliance purposes. These reports are designed to meet regulatory standards, simplifying the reporting process.
- Interactive Dashboard: Create a visually rich dashboard displaying real-time emissions graphs, carbon sinks vs emissions heatmaps, activity-wise emission donut charts, AI-powered forecast graphs, compliance scores, AI alerts, and a net-zero roadmap timeline, enhancing user engagement and understanding.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep navy blue (#2C3E50) to evoke a sense of industrial authority and environmental responsibility.
- Background color: Charcoal gray (#34495E), a desaturated navy hue, for a modern and serious feel.
- Accent color: Emerald green (#2ECC71), an analogous color that is higher in brightness and saturation than the primary and background colors, used to highlight key metrics and calls to action, symbolizing sustainability and growth.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for a modern and neutral feel that is suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use futuristic icons with a soft neumorphic style to represent various data points and actions, maintaining a clean and modern aesthetic.
- Implement a clean and intuitive layout with a focus on data visualization, using a grid system to ensure consistency and responsiveness across devices.
- Incorporate smooth transitions and subtle animations to enhance user engagement and provide a visually appealing experience without being distracting.
